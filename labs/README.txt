In this directory you will find 5 labs. The first 2 labs are to be used with MMLogic Multimedia. 
These two labs show my understanding of circuitry and logic design using various complex and simplified logic gates.

Labs 3,4, and 5 are wirtten in Assembly Language and any user attempting to run my code should use the MARS IDE for proper outputs.
