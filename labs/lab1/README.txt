Instructions on how to run any code or simulations

This program was created using the MML Software. The way to run
my program is to press play and stop and manually turn the switches on.

In this lab I, completed all parts - Part A, Part B and Part C

Part A
I connected the wires from the user input switches to the 7 segment display component

Part B
Designed a circuit that outputs the three bits shown in the truth table given the four bits as input. 
The three output bits have b_2 as the left-most bit and b_0 as the right-most bit. 

Part C
I implemented the truth table below using either Sum of Products (SOP) or Product of Sums (POS).
I outputed the result on the LED connected to receiver c_0.

I also implemented the SOP or POS using only NAND gates.
Output this result to the LED connected to receiver c_1.

Lastly, I build the same SOP or POS using only NOR gates. Output the result to c_2.
